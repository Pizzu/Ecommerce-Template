## Web App Main Features
On this app you can either purchase a single course or buy a membership PRO subscription and have access to all the courses. The courses and the lectures are created and fetched from a CMS (Sanity.io) where you can easily create a schema representing all the fields of the course. Every course has different lectures which may be free and accessible to everybody or require a purchase of the course before been able to watch the lectures.
The user can also keep track of every purchase, download the receipts, cancel a subscription, and modify billing informations.
Payments are handled through the Stripe Api and the App listens to its webhook events.
Authentication is handled using the Next Auth and Prisma (with Postgresql) as a DB.
