## Web App Main Features
This app allows users to purchase individual courses or subscribe to the PRO membership and gain access to all published courses. The courses and lectures are created and fetched from a CMS (Sanity.io). Every course is divided into lectures, some of which may be free and accessible to everybody while others require the user to purchase the course.
The app also allows users to track purchases, download receipts, cancel a subscription, and modify billing information.
Payments are handled through the Stripe API, and the App listens to its webhook events.
Authentication is handled using the Next Auth and Prisma (with Postgresql) as a DB.
